This directory contains the description of type checking. It also includes the
C++ code for the lexer, which you _can_ use, if you decide not to use your own
lexer. Similarly, you can choose to use E--.tab.h.

There is a test subdirectory that contains test inputs and the corresponding
outputs. These tests are provided to be helpful. But it is not necessary to
match your outputs exactly.
